Recursion:
  When a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.

    -->  Function will call itself
    -->  Well defined base case, other function will keep calling itself.

Segmentation fault / Stack overflow error:
  No proper base case specified.
  Function keeps calling itself recursively.
  Unfinished function calls pile up in stack.
  Stack memory gets filled ( limit depends on compiler )
  Throws error


Recursion Tree: 
  Pictorially represent the number of times the function has been recursively called.
  Then use arrows to show which function has been called after which one and then the return path of the functions too.
