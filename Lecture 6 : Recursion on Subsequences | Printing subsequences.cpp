Q. What is a subsequence?
Ans : it is a contiguous / non-contiguous sequence which follows the order.
      [ sub-array will always be contiguous ]
      
      following order means : [3,1,2] is the array    -     so [3,2,1] will not be a subsequence because 2 comes after 1 in the array
                                                            whereas [3,2] is a subsequence.
                                                          
      for [3,1,2] : { }
                    3
                    1
                    2
                    3 1
                    1 2
                    3 2
                    3 1 2                                   are all subsequences. { } is a subsequnce too because we've not selected any element and they're in order.
