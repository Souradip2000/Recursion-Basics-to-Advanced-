Does the sorting both in acending order as well as in descending order

Why Quick sort?
A : It has a time complexity similar to merge sort i.e. O(nlogn)
    but it has constant space complexity O(1) compared to linear space complexity of merge sort.

    Thus quick sort is slightly better than merge sort.
    Although there are some problems that can be solved only with the help of merge sort.


Steps:-
    1. Pick up a pivot element
    2. Place it in its correct position
    3. Put the remaining smaller elements on the left of the pivot and the larger ones on its right.

Rules to select the pivot element:
    Any element can be selected as the pivot element.
